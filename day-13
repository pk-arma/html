Day 13 — AJAX / Fetch / Axios

Interview Questions:

fetch vs axios?
:- Both Fetch and Axios are used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. Fetch is a built-in browser API, while Axios is a third-party library with more features. With Fetch, you need multiple .then() calls and manual JSON parsing, whereas Axios returns JSON directly and handles errors automatically. Axios also supports features like interceptors for centralized request handling, request cancellation, and better browser support. So, for simple requests Fetch is fine, but for larger applications or advanced features, Axios is generally preferred.

cors main use to check request origin domain and validate the domain.
