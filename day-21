Day 21 — Functional Programming (1.5 hr)

Immutability

Currying
:- currying is advance technique in functional programmering, where function tranceform into series of functions, each function take one argument.
This transformation allows a function that is normally called with multiple arguments, such as f(a, b, c), to be called as f(a)(b)(c).

```javascript


```
Composition
:-


Task: Implement curry().
